              <p>Anglia Farmers Limited is a co-operative buying group owned by its member shareholders. It evolved in 2003 from the merger of Loddon Farmers Limited and Mid-Norfolk Farmers Limited and is now the UK’s largest agricultural purchasing group. As such it has considerable buying power and attracts extremely keen prices on behalf of its members for a wide range of farm inputs, services and ancillary items. It also acts as a purchasing platform for other co-operative buying groups. 
                
              </p>
              <p>Determined collaboration between farmer directors, staff, group members and suppliers has propelled Anglia Farmers to become the UK’s largest agricultural purchasing group in the space of just four years.                </p>
              <p>This farmer-controlled co-operative business, based at Honingham Thorpe just outside Norwich, sources more than £175 million of supplies for farmers and other rural businesses. With this purchasing power it attracts considerable savings for its 1,700 full and 700 associate members. </p>

              <p>Anglia Farmers’ vision is to be the best, not just the largest, agricultural purchasing business in the UK. The facts, figures and satisfaction surveys show they are well on their way to achieving this but, sensibly, they do not intend to rest on the laurels. With the ever-challenging changes throughout agriculture, they know they cannot afford that luxury.
